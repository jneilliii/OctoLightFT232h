Just a test to get this plugin to work with CircuitPython's digitalio instead of RPI.GPIO

Forked from Gigibu5/OctoLight

Still trying to figure out the last few things. Any help would be appreciated. It installs. It activates. This one will turn the led off, and if you change "led.value = False" to "True" and reinstall it, the led will turn on. I'm trying to figure out how to get the button on the navbar to work.

If anyone wishes to have a look, let me know in issues if you have any suggestions to make the light work.
